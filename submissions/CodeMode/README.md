# CodeMode

CodeMode is a duckyscript that instantly sets up a new project and makes it way faster to start coding.

It initiates git, creates a README.md file, a MIT LICENSE file with the current year and the users name with user input, and allows the user to choose what type of project they are making and generates starter files for that project or if the project type isn't a choice it just creates a generic file to start coding in.
